# marvel-comics

## Setup ##
- The requests within this app require an API_KEY from Marvel's Developer API (developer.marvel.com) in order to work. A config file will be created at the projects root upon first build. Please add both public and private api keys to that file in order to use the application properly. Finally add marvelcomics_secrets.xcconfig to the project and set the configuration on the target.

## Libraries ##
- Combine
- CryptoKit
- Foundation
- SwiftUI
